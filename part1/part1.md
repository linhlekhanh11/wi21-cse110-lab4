1. What will happen at line 11 and why?
- It will print 3, which is the length of prices because even though var is in the for loop, the var has no block scope
2. What will happen at line 12 and why?
- It will print 150, the last value of discountedPrice value since even though the var is in the for loop, the var has no block scope
3. What will happen at line 13 and why?
- It will print out the value of finalPrice, 150
4. What will the function return if we call discountPrices([100,200,300], .5)
- 100, 200, and 300 are the value of prices
- It will run for loop 
        -  discountPrice became 50 
        -  finalPrice is 50
        -  discounted append 50 into the array

        - with i=1
        - discountedPrice became 100
        - finalPrice is 100
        - discounted append 100 into the array

        - with i=2
        - discountedPrice became 150 
        - after rounding, the finalPrice is 150
        - discounted append 150 into the array 

        -> this function will return discounted array with value: [50, 100, 150]
5. It will not print anything since i is declared inside the for loop
6. It will not print anything since discountedPrice is declared inside the for loop
7. It will print the finalPrice since finalPrice is declared inside the function
8. It will not be able to return anything 
9.  It will not print anything since i is declared inside the for loop
10. It will not print anything since discountedPrice is declared inside the for loop
11. It will not print the finalPrice since finalPrice is declared inside the function
12. It will not be able to return anything
13.
